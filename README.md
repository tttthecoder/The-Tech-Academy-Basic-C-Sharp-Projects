## Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input and gives user a calculated quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
## Twenty One Game
This project is a console application that simulates the famous 21 game. This project enables players to play games of 21 with their chosen bets until they either want to stop or their bank runs out. The project lends itself very well to the paradigm of object-oriented programming. 
## Student Database
This project makes a great use of the EntityFramework package. It creates a database using the Code-First approach available from the package.
